# Git-Rebasin-Weight-Matching-Demo
A demonstration of weight matching permutation coordinate descent from Git Rebasin [Samuel K. Ainsworth, Jonathan Hayase, Siddhartha Srinivasa - ICLR 2023]

An implementation of algorithm 2 from their paper on small neural networks with tSNE plots to visualize the rebasin process and qualatatively compare the trajectories of model weights over training steps.
